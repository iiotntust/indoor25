# Indoor Positioning System (IPS)

---

RSSI-based IPS should contain transmitters and receivers, known as beacon and scanner, respectively. This study uses the beacon-based configuration, with **beacons** placed in a **fixed position**, and the **scanner** acts as a **moving element**.

## How to use this repository

To implement this repository, please follow the instructions:

1️⃣ **Select your beacon model**. Currently, this repository provide code for the following beacons: Linkit 7697, Nano33, HC-42 <br>

2️⃣ **Build your database**. Currently, this repository provide documentation for the following database: MongoBD. <br>

3️⃣ **Build your rssi scanner**. Currently, this repository provide code for the following scanner: Linkit 7697 <br>

4️⃣ **Collect the rssi data**. <br>

## RSSI Collection

After the hardware and database has been established, the system is ready for data collection.

In this phase, the scanner will collect the data from the beacon, as the following image shows.

In each distance point, the scanner will collect a certain amount of RSSI signals, generating a comparison table of distance vs rssi.

## Required libraries


### Arduino IDE

```c=
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
// setup I2C address (LCD controller)
//     There are two different models of LCD, as follows:
//         0x3F (PCF8574A)
//         0x27 (PCF8574T)
```

```c=
//MQTT library
#include <PubSubClient.h>
```

---
### Python (to modify)

```typescript
// in background script
const fakeLogin = async () => true

channel.answer('isLogin', async () => {
  return await fakeLogin()
})
```

<br>

```typescript
// in inject script
const isLogin = await channel.callBackground('isLogin')
console.log(isLogin) //-> true
```
