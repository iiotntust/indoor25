# Indoor Positioning System (IPS)

---

RSSI-based IPS should contain transmitters and receivers, known as beacon and scanner, respectively. This study uses the beacon-based configuration, with **beacons** placed in a **fixed position**, and the **scanner** acts as a **moving element**.

## How to use this repository

To implement this repository, please follow the instructions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Select your beacon model**. Currently, this repository provide code for the following beacons: Linkit 7697, Nano33, HC-42 <br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Build your database**. Currently, this repository provide documentation for the following database: MongoBD. <br>

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Build your rssi scanner**. Currently, this repository provide code for the following scanner: Linkit 7697 <br>

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Collect the rssi data**. <br>

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create the UX/UI (Website)**.  <br>

## RSSI Collection

After the hardware and database has been established, the system is ready for data collection.<br>

In this phase, the scanner will collect the data from the beacon, as the following image shows.<br>

In each distance point, the scanner will collect a certain amount of RSSI signals, generating a comparison table of distance vs rssi.<br>

## Required libraries


### Arduino IDE

```c=
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
// setup I2C address (LCD controller)
//     There are two different models of LCD, as follows:
//         0x3F (PCF8574A)
//         0x27 (PCF8574T)
```

```c=
//MQTT library
#include <PubSubClient.h>
```

---
### Python (to modify)

```typescript
// in background script
const fakeLogin = async () => true

channel.answer('isLogin', async () => {
  return await fakeLogin()
})
```

<br>

```typescript
// in inject script
const isLogin = await channel.callBackground('isLogin')
console.log(isLogin) //-> true
```

### Wrap up

- Cross envornment commnication
- A small library to solve messaging pain
- TypeScript Rocks :tada:
